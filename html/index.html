            <h3>Salam or Hello,</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Rayyan Sarkhot. I am going to be a junior at Rutgers New Brunswick pursuing a
              B.S. in Computer Science. This is my portfolio website, where I give every curious soul a deeper
              look into my mysterious life. And show some of my coding projects as well.
            </p>
            <p>I mainly specialize in backend web development with techonologies such as NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS,
              Nginx, and Google Cloud Platform. Besides these and other techonologies that interest me, I have
              a large affinity for computer networking and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides being a coder, I take great part in helping the youth and community around me. Often times,
              you will find me developing my local Young Muslims chapter, which is dedicated to creating an 
              environment to grow and develop future Muslims. Besides that, I also love to help others by 
              volunteering through my local mosque and university for the benefit of others.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's enough about me. You can scroll down to look at some of the code I am and have worked on.

          <h3>YOUNG MUSLIMS SUMMER LEAGUE STAT TRACKER</h3>
          <p>This project was created for the local Young Muslims chapter I partake in. They run their
            annual basketball league called YMSL and would resort to Excel sheets or pen & paper to track stats.
            And the eventual display of players' stats would be through a large Google Sheet.<br> I knew it could
            be better.
          </p>
          <p>Using several technologies, I published a website for the players to access their stats 24/7 and 
            introduce new players to the beauty of YMSL. 
          </p>
          <p>This site was made with HTML, CSS, Js, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Nginx, Docker, Google Sheets API, & Google
            Cloud Platform.

          <h3>MUNICIPAL VOTER GENERATOR</h3>
          <p>I was reached out by an assistant of a local politician campaigning for a muncipal position.
            He told me their team were targeting the Muslim voters to gain their votes. But
            they were scanning a 30,000+ row call bank for Muslim voters.
          </p>
          <p>This was a big problem.</p>
